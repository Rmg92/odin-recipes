    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A small twist for the corn on the cob</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Cajun seasoning </li>
        <li>2 ears fresh corn, sliced into 6 equal-sized rings </li>
        <li>sea salt to taste </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives </li>
        <li>¼ cup ranch dressing, or to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine butter, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and Cajun seasoning in a microwave-safe dish
            and cook in the microwave until butter is fully melted, about 1 minute. Remove from microwave and stir.
        </li>
        <li>Use tongs to dip a corn ring into the spiced butter, making sure to coat it thoroughly in the spices.
            Transfer to a plate and continue until all of the rings have been dipped. There will be butter
            remaining.</li>
        <li>Heat an oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Once heated, place corn rings into the skillet, season them
            individually with sea salt, and let them sizzle away until a nice sear has developed, about 3 minutes.
            Flip and use a basting brush to brush remaining butter onto the seared sides of the rings. Season again
            with salt and continue to cook for 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the skillet into the preheated oven and cook for 10 minutes. Carefully flip the rings and cook
            for 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and transfer to a serving platter. Sprinkle chives over top and serve with ranch
            dressing, along with corn skewers for picking up individual rings.</li>
    </ol>
